\usage{
make_request(
  url = NULL,
  api_secret = NULL,
  schema = "entries",
  spec = "sgv",
  find = NULL,
  count = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{Base URL for accessing Nightscout of type `https://YOUR-SITE.com`. See https://nightscout-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Nightscout/EN/Technical%20info/api.html for further details. `ap/i/v1` is automatically added to the end of the base url when creating the request.}

\item{api_secret}{API secret or token as entered when accessing the base URL via a web browser. This API secret is hashed using Secure Hash Algorithm 1 prior to appending to header of API request.}

\item{schema}{Schema to be requested. For CGM data use `entries`, for Care Portal Treatments use `treatments`, for Treatment Profiles use `profiles`. and for server status and settings use `status`.}

\item{spec}{Relevant for schema `entries` only. entry id, such as 55cf81bc436037528ec75fa5 or a type filter such as sgv, mbg, etc. Default is 'sgv' which returns sensor glucose values (SGV).}

\item{find}{The query used to find and limit returned data. Supports nested query syntax, for example find[dateString][$gte]=2015-08-27. All find parameters are interpreted as strings. By default the `entries` and `treatments` schemas limit results to the the most recent 10 values from the last 2 days. You can get many more results, by using the date, dateString, and created_at parameters, depending on the type of data youâ€™re looking for. See https://YOUR-SITE.com/api-docs.html for more options. Can use command `find_between` to help create correct query. Not valid and ignored for `profile` and `status` schemas.}

\item{count}{By default the `entries` and `treatments` schemas limit results to the the most recent 10 values from the last 2 days. You can get many more results by setting this to a higher number. Can set to `Inf` to get all results between two dates defined in `find`. Not valid and ignored for `profile` and `status` schemas.}
